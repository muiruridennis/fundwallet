            <h1>The Best Practices to Attain Wealth and Happiness</h1> 
            <p>Most people want to have a big financial muscle that will enable them to live the best life in the world. Everyone has a big and common goal of making more money.
               However, this is not a walk in the park as only a small percentage of us have been able to achieve the financial freedom that we have been longing for.
                Below are the best practices to achieve financial freedom.

            </p>
            <h6>1. Do not save, invest</h6>
            <p>The biggest secret about rich people in the world is that they invest their money in risky but profitable business
              rather than saving their money. Saving is not a bad idea but it will help you much to achieve the financial freedom as investing
              would do. Do not fear taking that loan to invest.

            </p>
            <h6>2. Start having a positive mindset</h6>
            <p>Start to think positively about money. Thinking negatively about money is a big 
              emotional hindrance to achieving wealth and happiness. Get rid of the notion that money can 
              not buy happiness and that the more money you make the more it bleeds immorality.
               A positive mindset brings about opportunities that you might not have imagined.
            </p>
            <h6>3. Set a roadmap for financial freedom.</h6>
            <p>
            Construct a plan of actions and strategies regarding the attainment of financial freedom. 
            This formula has worked for many. Believe it or not bu Setting up and writing
             down your goals creates a sense of thinking about them every day which increases
              the chances of achieving them.  </p>
